AutoHotKey scripts that I use

In short:

BetterKeys is for laptops (Includes brightness changes which are useless on desktops)

BeterKeysMediaOnly is for desktops

To make sure the scripts go off automatically (anytime you restart your computer you will normally have to execute the scripts again):
	Hold Windows key + R
	Type "shell:startup" and hit enter. You will be taken to a startup folder.
	Find where your script is, right click, select "Create Shortcut".
	Drag and drop the shortcut you made into this startup folder.
