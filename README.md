AutoHotKey scripts that I use

In short:

BetterKeys is for laptops (Includes brightness changes which are useless on desktops)

BeterKeysMediaOnly is for desktops

To make sure the scripts go off automatically (anytime you restart your computer you will normally have to execute the scripts again):

	Find where your script is, right click, select "Create Shortcut".
	
	Hold Windows key + R
	
	Type "shell:startup" and hit enter. You will be taken to a startup folder.
	
	Drag and drop the shortcut you made into this startup folder.

To use original function keys (F5, F6, F10, F11, F12 are rebound) you now use them by holding shift and pressing them. So to F5 (like for refreshing a page on your browser) you need to do Shift+F5, because F5 lowers brightness.
